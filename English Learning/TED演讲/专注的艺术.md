In the fall of 2005,
00:21
I find myself at the Military World Championship in shooting.
00:26
I'm in the lead in the final,
00:30
and I have one shot left to shoot.
00:36
The target is 50 metres away,
00:39
and the ten is 10.4 millimetres.
00:44
What is it that determines if I shoot a nine or a ten?
00:50
Is it the physics, the technique,
00:55
the relaxation or the breathing?
01:00
No, those are abilities that everybody at that level
01:04
has been training for years.
01:09
It's all about the thoughts I think and why I think them.
01:16
This is what focus is about.
01:21
When I was 23 years old,
01:23
I felt that I had a kind of capacity, an inner drive and an energy
01:28
that I didn't really know how to handle.
01:30
And it frustrated me,
01:32
not knowing what to do or where to go in this world.
01:36
I was completely lost.
01:38
And the only solution I could think of
01:40
was trying to become best in the world
01:46
at ... something.
01:50
I had no idea in what.
01:54
But I decided to become a world champion.
01:58
I was quite athletic,
02:00
but my helpful brother pointed out
02:02
that I was too old to become a world-class sprinter.
02:08
So I choose shooting.
02:14
This determination brought me into the military arena,
02:20
and since that very day, I started my practice.
02:24
Thousands of hours were spent on the shooting range.
02:27
I ate on the range.
02:29
I slept on the range.
02:31
And still today,
02:33
I can remember that smell of lead and loneliness.
02:38
I travelled all over the country, competing, for three years,
02:43
but I lost over and over again,
02:46
not getting any reward or recognition.
02:50
In my world, I was programmed to win,
02:53
but I didn't.
02:55
And I couldn't understand how it could be so incredibly difficult.
03:02
It was only my perseverance that kept me going.
03:11
In this very moment at the World Championship
03:16
aiming at the target with these irritatingly tight margins,
03:22
and these nervous thoughts running through my head,
03:25
this potential triumph could easily become yet another fiasco.
03:35
But then, suddenly,
03:38
I saw, and I focused on,
03:41
a beautiful autumn leaf playing in the wind.
03:47
I give this leaf my full attention.
03:53
And suddenly, I am completely calm.
04:03
And the world champion title is mine.
04:07
(Applause)
04:12
This was -
04:14
This action was a deliberate choice
04:17
and the result of persistent mental training.
04:21
Because this leaf relieved me of distracting thoughts
04:25
and made me focused.
04:30
And the phenomena of focus interested me more and more,
04:34
not only in peak performance but also in the longer perspective
04:39
and in life in general.
04:42
I studied this vital capacity,
04:48
and what I saw was
04:50
that the human mind struggled with focus
04:54
on three distinctive ways.
04:59
First,
05:01
our minds are often full of disturbing thoughts,
05:04
often worried about not being good enough.
05:09
Second,
05:10
instead of working with what we already know,
05:12
we are constantly focused on what we will achieve.
05:18
And third,
05:19
we are frustrated for not having time.
05:23
So, how can we help ourselves with these problems?
05:28
Well, before we can discuss that,
05:30
we need to find out what focus is.
05:35
In today's overflow, with new waves and trends,
05:40
the ability to focus has been somewhat overlooked
05:44
despite its great value.
05:46
It's, however, a particularly complex function of our intelligent brain.
05:51
So, let me simplify it for you.
05:56
The pre-eminently thinking human beings,
06:00
all of us in here, I guess,
06:05
have the ability to think forward and backward in time.
06:12
And we often go down the alarming path of thinking,
06:17
What happens if ... ?
06:20
What happens if I shoot a nine?
06:22
If I forget what to say having a presentation?
06:26
If I don't finish my report on time?
06:29
If I start losing followers on social media?
06:32
If life doesn't turn out the way we had anticipated?
06:36
Or we worry about why it didn't turn out the way we wanted it to.
06:43
Can we then, at moments of need,
06:46
free ourselves from these disturbing and worrying thoughts,
06:51
a kind of undemanding present arise?
06:56
Because it's in this undemanding present that we are focused.
07:01
It's here that we perform and function exactly as well as we are.
07:10
So, standing there, shaking with nervousness
07:15
but giving that leaf my full attention,
07:18
this is what happened.
07:23
So, focus is simply about choosing the right thought
07:27
among thousands of thoughts.
07:33
Now, how do we get focused?
07:37
Well, firstly, regarding the disturbing thoughts.
07:41
We need to learn to notice disturbing thoughts
07:44
and to distinguish them from not disturbing thoughts.
07:51
A not disturbing thought is something completely neutral,
07:55
like a lamp,
07:57
a chair,
07:59
a belt,
08:02
a toaster
08:04
or an autumn leaf.
08:06
Because as the brain, in broad terms, only can focus on one thing at a time,
08:13
a not disturbing thought
08:15
knocks out all the disturbing and worrying thoughts.
08:18
And this is enough to reach that inner capacity
08:22
we in fact already possess.
08:26
Second,
08:28
regarding how we constantly focus on what we will achieve.
08:36
In the performance-based society of today,
08:39
we often lose focus
08:40
because we constantly strive towards the new and better
08:44
instead of finding our inner power
08:47
and constructively working with what we are best at
08:50
at each given moment.
08:55
Because if we always think about the goal,
08:58
about what we want to achieve,
09:00
about where we want to go,
09:01
about who we want to become,
09:04
our focus is constantly on the future
09:07
and not on the work that needs to be done now.
09:14
So, removing the goal now and then is not as crazy as it sounds.
09:19
Well, scary at first.
09:21
I mean, where we're going now?
09:23
But that is how focus ends up
09:26
on who we are
09:27
and what we have
09:28
instead of chasing after what we are not and do not have.
09:34
So, focus is not about becoming something new or something better,
09:38
but simply about functioning exactly as well as we already are
09:43
and understanding that this is enough
09:46
for both general happiness and great achievements.
09:54
Third,
09:55
regarding frustration for not having time.
10:01
We live in a time with endless possibilities around us,
10:08
and this seems to have created the notion that life must be lived intensely.
10:15
We try to exceed on all arenas at the same time,
10:19
and one's self-confidence ends up on all that we do
10:24
instead of placing focus on one thing
10:26
and doing this really, really well.
10:31
Our focus shatters into a thousand little must-dos and must-haves,
10:36
and time is somehow eaten up.
10:42
But the principle is quite simple:
10:45
The more possibilities, the more there is to refrain from.
10:49
Today is no longer about prioritizing
10:53
but about prioritizing away.
10:58
Imagine yourself sitting at your desk in the morning
11:01
and making a must-to-do list.
11:03
Now challenge yourself and make a not-to-do list,
11:09
and your brain will automatically shift in focus.
11:17
Also, it's funny, despite our unique ability to think long-term,
11:21
we want immediate response on our efforts.
11:26
Posting a picture on social media, for instance.
11:29
We live our life with short-term focus,
11:36
and we are losing the ability to build our own self-esteem
11:40
without constant feedback from others.
11:46
So, how do we find a long-term focus,
11:50
that focus that moves your life in the right direction?
11:56
Achieving long-term focus
11:58
requires that we learn to direct our attention inwards.
12:03
To that what I call our inner core.
12:06
To that which doesn't need a constant response.
12:10
Because it's here, and perhaps only here,
12:14
that we find genuine contentment and satisfaction
12:18
with who we are.
12:24
So, why is all this so important to us all?
12:30
Focus is important
12:32
because several essential abilities are linked to this innate skill.
12:36
The ability to listen, to learn, to empathise,
12:40
and not at least, to steer our self and our life in the right direction.
12:46
And as the pace in our society will increase even more,
12:51
it will require quite a lot to navigate in this new unpredictable era,
12:57
with a constantly growing roar around us.
13:02
And you know what?
13:04
We must control the intense society.
13:08
The intense society must not control us.
13:12
And for this, we need to stay sharp and focused.
13:22
But do you know what I'm worried about?
13:26
I am concerned that our ability to steer our focus with our own power
13:31
is something we are about to lose.
13:34
I'm worried that we, in the future, will see two groups of people:
13:38
those with the ability to co-exist and handle the intense society,
13:44
and those who will become more or less slaves under the same possibilities.
13:53
Although we as adults are struggling with our focus more than ever,
13:58
we still have a sense about what focus is.
14:04
But what about our coming generations?
14:08
What if our generation is the last one with access to this life-affirming tool?
14:15
Here, we own a responsibility
14:18
in ensuring that this ability is maintained in the future.
14:25
Because focus, this vital force, is what brings out the best in ourselves
14:32
and in others, something our world so greatly deserves.
14:40
Now, finally, embrace the ability you have within yourself
14:46
to be able to see the value
14:48
of a small autumn leaf playing in the wind.
